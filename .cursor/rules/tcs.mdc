description: Convert a natural-language statement into minimal, standards-compliant code changes in src/main/java
globs:
alwaysApply: false

### Purpose
- Take a user statement like "Add a service to fetch Pet by name and expose it via /v2/pet/byName?name=Fluffy" and implement only the necessary application code under `src/main/java`, aligned with existing structure and standards.

### Standards to follow
- Use constructor injection for Spring components
- Add JavaDoc comments for all public methods and fields
- Prefer null-safety (avoid returning null; use Optional where reasonable)
- Keep changes minimal and backward-compatible

### Inputs (from the statement)
- Desired behavior (what to add/change)
- Affected layer(s): model, service, controller, configuration
- For REST: HTTP method, path, params/body, success status, key response fields
- Optional two-part format to also define tests in one statement:
  - Implement: <implementation statement>
  - Test: <integration test statement>

### Decision guide
- If the change adds/changes a REST endpoint that should be part of the contract:
  - Update the OpenAPI spec and run `@regen.mdc` instead of hand-editing generated controllers
- If implementing internal logic or glue code without changing the contract:
  - Add/update service/component classes and call them from existing controllers

### Procedure
1) Analyze statement and locate targets
   - Search in `src/main/java/org/openapitools/...` for the relevant package
   - Identify whether there is an existing controller/service to extend

2) Implement minimal code edits
   - Create/extend a Spring `@Service` or `@Component` using constructor injection
   - Wire into existing controllers where appropriate
   - Add JavaDoc for public APIs

3) If REST contract must change
   - Update `petstore-<version>.yaml` accordingly
   - Run:
   ```bash
   @regen.mdc
   ```

4) Cleanup and formatting
   - Remove unused imports and trivial unused code
   ```bash
   mvn -B org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.41.0:run \
     -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java:1.31.0 \
     -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.RemoveUnusedImports,org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UnusedLocalVariables,org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UnusedPrivateMethod
   ```
   - Apply shared formatter
   ```bash
   @format.mdc
   ```

5) Optional: generate integration tests for the new behavior
   - If the original statement contained a "Test:" part, pass that as the test statement
   - Otherwise, reuse the "Implement:" (or whole) statement to derive tests
```bash
@ffis.mdc
```

### Templates
- See `@coding-standard.mdc` for:
  - Service template (Java)
  - Controller wiring example (Java)

### Notes
- Do not place custom logic directly inside generated code blocks that may be overwritten by regeneration. Prefer delegating to services/components you control.
- If you must change the contract, prefer updating OpenAPI and regenerating to keep drift at zero.
